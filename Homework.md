# Homework
Your homework is to change each of your print statements from 3.4.1 Math Exercises Assignment using BOTH string concatentation AND f-strings.
Do not delete your original print statement. ADD the new print statements to each file. 

## For example, in your AreaOfRectangle.py file:

```python
# Output title
print("** Area of a Rectangle Calculator **")

# Get the length and width from user
length_cm = float(input("Enter the length (cm): "))
width_cm = float(input("Enter the width (cm): "))

# Calculate area = l * w
area = length_cm * width_cm

# Output area
print("The area of your rectangle is", area, "cm^2")
## Add your new print statement using string concatentation here
## Add your new print statement using f-strings here.
```

NOTE: Run you code to make sure ALL three print statements look the same.
